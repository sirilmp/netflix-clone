Netflix clone is the first react.js project. Here I am using the TMDB API for fetching movie data, for state manage I using redux. Firebase used for user signUp/signIn and also storing user selected plan details. Both [movie-trailer](www.google.com) and react-youtube npm modules are using for finding trailer and play in youTube.
